- generating data
  - random bits strings
  - parsing images to bits strings
- generating disturabance in forwarded data
- coding data with algotirhms
  - Hamming code
  - tripling bits (aaa bbb ccc)
  - tripling bits (abc abc abc)
  - BCH
- decoding data and errors correction
- analizing and comparing results
